# Development Notes

## Initial Setup (Completed)
- Created Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- Set up basic project structure
- Implemented initial components:
  - Card.tsx (draggable card component)
  - SortingContainer.tsx (main container)
  - Basic type definitions

## Current State
- Basic UI structure is in place
- Drag-and-drop functionality partially implemented
- Sorting algorithm implementations pending

## Next Steps
1. Implement sorting algorithms:
   - Bubble Sort
   - Selection Sort
   - Insertion Sort
   - Quick Sort
   - Merge Sort

2. Enhance drag-and-drop functionality:
   - Add drop zones between cards
   - Implement card swapping animation
   - Add visual feedback during sorting

3. Add features:
   - Speed control for sorting visualization
   - Card count adjustment
   - Reset functionality
   - Step-by-step sorting mode

## Build Instructions
1. Development:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   - Runs development server at http://localhost:3000
   - Hot reloading enabled
   - TypeScript type checking

2. Production Build:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm start
   ```

3. Testing:
   ```bash
   npm run test
   ```

## Deployment
- Configured for Vercel deployment
- Environment variables (if needed):
  - Add to `.env.local` for development
  - Configure in Vercel dashboard for production

## Technical Debt & Improvements
- [ ] Add proper error boundaries
- [ ] Implement proper loading states
- [ ] Add unit tests
- [ ] Add accessibility features
- [ ] Optimize animations for performance
- [ ] Add proper TypeScript types for all components
